# Overview

`@o2-ui/react-icon` is more than a set of visual components; it is designed so that users, search engines, crawlers, AI agents, and assistive technologies can all extract meaningful information from web documents.

## Core Philosophy

While most icon libraries primarily focus on visual presentation, `@o2-ui/react-icon` equally emphasizes semantic accessibility and machine readability. Each SVG element comes with built-in accessibility attributes such as ARIA, allowing developers to produce semantically rich documents with minimal effort. As a result, applications using this library automatically deliver content that is not only visually appealing but also structured, interpretable, and inclusive for every agent interacting with the web.

## Key Features

- **Built-in Accessibility**: ARIA attributes included for full compatibility with screen readers
- **Machine-Readable**: Provides document structures that search engines, crawlers, and AI models can understand
- **Developer-Friendly**: Generates semantic documents without requiring manual accessibility setup
- **Consistent & Scalable**: Maintains design system consistency while supporting scalable usage

## How It Works

`@o2-ui/react-icon` provides the following advantages, optimized for SSR, lightweight design, and accessibility:

- **SSR Enabled**: As React components, icons can be server-rendered into HTML, improving initial load performance and SEO. Accessibility attributes remain intact in the server-rendered output.
- **Lightweight by Design**: Only necessary SVG icons are included, minimizing bundle size and eliminating unused code.
- **Built-in Accessibility**: Every SVG comes with ARIA and other accessibility attributes so that developers achieve semantic richness with no extra effort.
- **Consistent with the Design System**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with the o2-ui design system, ensuring consistent styling across components.

`@o2-ui/react-icon` is not just a toolkit for rendering icons but an enterprise-grade UI component library that enriches the semantic layer of the web.
